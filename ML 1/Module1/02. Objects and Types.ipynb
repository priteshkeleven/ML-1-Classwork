    "## Every \"value\" in Python is an \"object\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, the term **value** has been used to refer to numbers (2, 3, -99, etc..) and booleans (`True` and `False`). Formally, all of these values are **objects**. The term object will seem abstract at the moment, but a good first (yet incomplete) analogy is to think of objects as you would physical objects in the real world. For instance, I'm currently in a bedroom writing this book and see a bed, mirror, chair, desk, lamp, phone, etc... These are all objects just like all numbers and booleans are Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything that can be assigned to a variable in Python is an object and a common expression associated with Python is that \"everything is an object\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Every object has a type\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important concepts to internalize when learning Python is that every object has a **type**. An object's type is one of the most fundamental properties of an object. Again, an analogy to the real-world can be useful. Let's imagine that one of your friends calls you and says \"I need you to get me an object\". You might respond with \"Wow, that's one of the weirdest requests I've ever gotten\". But, since you are a friend you might also ask \"What **type** of object do you need?\". Your friend might respond with something like \"cup\", \"sugar\", \"lawnmower\", \"scissors\", etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these words would be considered types and represent a generic description of which many specific physical objects would be suitable for your friend.. If your friend did respond with \"cup\" for instance, then you might go into your kitchen and see that you have 10 different styles of cups. The one cup that you select to bring to your friend is the actual physical object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we used many objects to understand how to work with operators. For example, when we run the code `5 + 3`, we adding together two objects. The numbers 3 and 5 are both objects. The addition symbol is an operator and NOT an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `type` function\n",
    "To formally find an object's type in Python, we can use the `type` function. A formal discussion of functions will happen in a future chapter. Using the `type` function is simple. Place the object within parentheses following the `type` function. We say, we **call** the `type` function."

    "The formal Python type of the object 5 is `int` which stands for **integer**. All Python types have very strict definitions that describe what objects of that type can do. By knowing that the object 5 is an integer, we immediately understand many things about it. For instance, it can be used in an expression with the arithmetic and comparison operators from the last chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to our friend who needs a cup. While there is no universally agreed upon technical definition for a cup, there are many practical ones. Perhaps you could say that a cup is an object constructed from solid material, typically cylindrical in shape containing no material on the top, is easy to hold and is used to place liquid within.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental piece of information for any object in Python is its type. You must know what type of object you are dealing with so that you can know how its properties and how it behaves with the rest of your program. This is very similar to the real world. When we look at physical objects, we usually have no time labeling them as a particular type of object. This abstraction is useful for understanding what the object's general properties and abilities are. It also makes conversation much easier. A single word, \"cup\" can be used instead of that terribly long description I attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology type vs object\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to be able to distinguish between the terms type and object. They are related but not the same. The numbers 5, 3, and -99 are all objects in Python. When you create them, they are physically located in memory on your machine. They literally exist. All of them are integers, technically of type `int`. All objects of the same type will generally behave similarly just like all cups will behave similarly though not all alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only a single integer type in Python, but there are many, many integer objects that can be created. In fact, there is no limit to the length of an integer in Python. The term **instance** is often used to refer to a single member of a particular type. 5, 3, and -99 are all instances of the `int` type. More coverage will be devoted to this in the chapters on classes and object-oriented programming."
