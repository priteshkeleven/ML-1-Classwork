    "One of Python's most powerful built-in types is the **`list`**. In generic programming terminology, lists are considered [data structures][1], or more simply put, a collection of data. Lists are very versatile, capable of many tasks, are very popular, and something you will use frequently when writing Python. Even crude data exploration and matrix algebra can be done using lists. \n",

    "Lists are mutable sequences of objects. Anything can go inside lists, even other lists. Lists are declared by the brackets **`[ ]`** operator followed by comma separated values. Let's declare a list with some integer, string, and float objects.\n",

Languages that allow variables to refer to more than one type are called **dynamically typed**. **Statically typed** languages on the other hand do not allow for variables to change types after declaration.

    "**`range`** is a function that can be used to create a sequence of numbers using the same start, stop, step style of list and string slicing we have already seen. Range is different in that it doesn't actually create the sequence of numbers in your computer's memory when its first called. It 'lazily' evaluates, meaning it only generates the next number in the sequence when demanded. Get [more information on the range function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13092267/if-range-is-a-generator-in-python-3-3-why-can-i-not-call-next-on-a-range).\n",
